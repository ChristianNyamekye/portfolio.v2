Focused on linear algebra and mathematical modeling to build a multi-layer MNIST architecture with forward and backward propagation, integrating linear and nonlinear layers and MSE loss functions. Validated the model with numerical derivatives and gradient descent optimization, achieving significant performance gains in regression and classification tasks compared to baseline models. ~200 loc
